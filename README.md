The following technologies were used to create the site:

- CSS

## CREDITS

The places that inspired me either in terms of look, or functionality:

- [Texas Burger](http://www.texasburger.hu) - I liked how the gallery looked and functioned, tried to create something similar. They have a world class brownie by the way.
- [Koml√≥ Szombathely](https://komloszombathely.hu) - I really liked the general design of the site, especially the contacts and menu page. They serve the Nr. 1 lemonade in western Hungary.
